* Added new filter type: range between two numbers
* Added new attribute to yadcf constructor: filter_type (String), possible values are select / auto_complete / range_number, (default is select)
   - In order to set custom labels for the range inputs use the filter_default_label attribute with array of two string as input , example: filter_default_label: ["myFrom", "myTo"]
